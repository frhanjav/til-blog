As shown in the Silicon Valley episode "Two Days of the Condor" (S2E10), this episode beautifully illustrates what happens when you don't prepare for that sudden, exponential traffic growth.

Pied Piper, a compression platform, finds its livestream of a museum technician falling into a ravine going viral. This isn't just a slow build-up; the link gets shared by a major celebrity in the Philippines, Manny Pacquiao, to his two million followers.

### Sudden, Unanticipated Viral Load:

Suddenly, the livestream's viewers skyrocket, eventually crossing 300,000 viewers. This massive and unexpected influx of traffic puts an immediate and severe strain on Pied Piper's servers.

### Manual, Desperate Measures:

Instead of automated, proactive scaling, we see Gilfoyle frantically trying to keep breakers from tripping and Dinesh manually working to keep the servers online. It’s a reactive, human-intensive effort against an overwhelming tide.

### The Ultimate Shortage: 

Servers on Fire! The consequence is immediate and dramatic: with 300,000 viewers, Pied Piper's servers catch on fire. This is the ultimate "shortage" – a complete lack of operational capacity, leading to total system failure.

### The Takeaway

This unprepared scaling is what users aren't prepared for. Even with major cloud providers, scaling is a very crucial task because even minutes of downtime can cause significant losses to big companies. That's why robust scaling is absolutely needed.

Even major cloud providers can experience significant outages. The Google Cloud incident from April 25-26, 2023, is a perfect illustration. During the incident, Google's official status page offered a clear workaround: "Customers can failover to zones in other regions". This highlights a crucial point: no small or big company that is just hosted in one zone can afford to too strongly trust the cloud without their own disaster recovery planning or over-rely on reactive autoscaling alone. Even with cloud providers offering resilience, proactive architectural decisions and multi-region/multi-zone strategies are essential to mitigate the impact of unforeseen failures, like those caused by a physical disaster in a data center.

So, when you're building your next big thing, remember to prepare for three times of peak, test like your business depends on it, and understand every single link in your chain. And always consider what happens when your underlying infrastructure, even from a major cloud provider, faces unexpected challenges. Because while server fires make for great TV, they're the last thing you want for your users!

### The Crucial Difference in Scaling with Pied Piper and Hotstar

{{< backlink "hotstar" "How Hotstar Application Scaled 25 Million Concurrent Users">}}

The contrast couldn't be starker. Hotstar's ability to handle millions of concurrent users without shortages comes from relentless testing, proactive resource provisioning, understanding system limitations (including external ones), and having fallback mechanisms. They know their "related capacity" and are always pushing its limits in a controlled environment.
