There’s something powerful about learning every day—no matter how small. The moment you stop, the curve begins to dip. Not in a dramatic way, but slowly, subtly. You won’t even notice it at first.

But when you keep learning—reading a page, watching a video, tinkering with a concept—it builds. You might not see the result instantly, but later, maybe weeks or even months down the line, you’ll come across something and suddenly think, “Wait, I’ve seen this before.” That’s when the dots start to connect.

And most importantly, you start seeing patterns, ideas, and overlaps you never would’ve imagined before.

It’s tempting to feel guilty for exploring things “off-track” or outside of your core goals. But the truth is: no learning ever goes to waste. Everything you pick up shapes how you think and how you solve problems. You become better—even if you don’t realize it right away.

So, Keep learning. It compounds.
